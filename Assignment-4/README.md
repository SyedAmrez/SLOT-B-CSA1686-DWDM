1. Imagine that you have selected data from the AllElectronics data warehouse for analysis. The data set will be huge! The following data are a list of AllElectronicsprices for commonly sold items (rounded to the nearest dollar). The numbers have been sorted: 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 12, 14, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18,
18, 18, 18, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21, 21, 21, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 28, 28, 30,
30, 30.

(i) Partition the dataset using an equal-frequency partitioning method with bin equal to 3
(ii)  apply data smoothing using bin means and bin boundary.
(iii) Plot Histogram for the above frequency division

2. Perform the Association analysis for supermarket data set.

3.Implementation of the Data Segmentation by Expectation Maximization  (EM) Algorithm  and K- means through WEKA using “cancer”  dataset.    
1. Cluster   2.  Visualize
