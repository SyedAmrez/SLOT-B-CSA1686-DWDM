1. The following values are the number of pencils available in the different boxes. Create a vector and find out the mean, median and mode values of set of pencils in the given data.

Box1	Box2	Box3	Box4	Box5	Box6	Box7	Box8	Box9

25	   23	   12	   11	   6	   7	   8	   9	   10

2. Suppose that the data for analysis includes the attribute age. The age values for the data tuples are (in increasing order) 13, 15, 16, 16, 19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 22, 25, 25, 25, 25, 30, 33, 33, 35, 35, 35, 35, 36, 40, 45, 46, 52, 70.
Can you find (roughly) the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data?

3. Two Maths teachers are comparing how their Year 9 classes performed in the end of year exams. Their results are as follows:
