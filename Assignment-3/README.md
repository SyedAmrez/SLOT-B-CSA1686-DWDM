Assignment Topics: 

01. (a) Suppose that a hospital tested the age and body fat data for 18 randomly selected adults
with the following results:

Age       %fat    
 23   -   9.5  
 23   -   26.5   
 27   -   7.8   
 27   -   17.8  
 39   -   31.4    
 41   -   25.9   
 47   -   27.4   
 49   -   27.2    
 50   -   31.2   
 52   -   34.6    
 54   -   42.5    
 54   -   28.8   
 56   -   33.4   
 57   -   30.2   
 58   -   34.1    
 58   -   32.9   
 60   -   41.2    
 61   -   35.7  
 
(a) Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of age and %fat.
(b) Draw the boxplots for age and %fat.
(c) Draw a scatter plot and a q-q plot based on these two variables.

2. Create the Confusion matrix using this scenario:

      A shepherd boy gets bored tending the town's flock. To have some fun, he cries out, "Wolf!" even though no wolf is in sight. The villagers run to protect the flock, but then get really mad when they realize the boy was playing a joke on them.One night, the shepherd boy sees a real wolf approaching the flock and calls out, "Wolf!" The villagers refuse to be fooled again and stay in their houses. The hungry wolf turns the flock into lamb chops. The town goes hungry. Panic ensues.

3. a)Let us consider one example to make the calculation method clear. Assume that the minimum and maximum values for the feature F are $50,000 and $100,000 correspondingly. It needs to range F from 0 to 1. In accordance with min-max normalization, v = $80,000

b) Use the two methods below to normalize the following group of data: 200, 300, 400, 600, 1000

 (a) min-max normalization by setting min = 0 and max = 1
 
 (b) z-score normalization


1)Mean,Median,Standard Deviation,Scatter plot,Box plot

2)Confusion Matrix

3)Min-Max and Z score Normalization
